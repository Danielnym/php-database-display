# php-database-display
Source code of php for database connection and display database data in table format in the browser

I've written database script separately from xampp, where in xampp i only used it for php purposes, connecting and displaying.

Steps to run:

. Install xampp for running the php functionalities.
- After installing xampp use the connection.php file to test the connection between the database and php, the source code is below.
- Sql scripts can be used in mysql workbench and run.
- In other files here, there are sql scripts for the whole database data.
- First run apache in php, then with this link:"http://127.0.0.1/DBcncct/Connection.php" the browser shows the message from the php code as "connection successful". then for the display, the link:"http://127.0.0.1/DBcnnct/Index.php".
- After these above steps you csn see the displays of database data in table format in the browser.
